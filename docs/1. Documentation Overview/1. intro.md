# Introduction

To keep everything organized, scheduled, and easily accessible, I've created this website as a central place to track and document my research journey. Here, you’ll find a detailed roadmap with dates, notes, and step-by-step updates on each part of the project.

Explore the sidebar to navigate through the different sections of my research, where I've outlined each phase with meticulous detail.
