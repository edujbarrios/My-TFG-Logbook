# Exploring Google Colab Combined with Gemini for Project Use

In this section, I explore the possibilities of utilizing Google Colab alongside Gemini to support our project needs. By integrating Google Colab's accessible environment with Gemini, we can leverage powerful tools for processing and fine-tuning models, particularly with image datasets.

## Key Resources and Links

The following links provide an introduction to setting up and working with Google Colab and Gemini for generative AI applications:

## Free Version of Gemini: Fine-Tuning Options

For our purposes, the primary concern is determining the feasibility of using Gemini's free version for extensive fine-tuning with a substantial amount of image data. Initial investigation suggests that, like ChatGPT, Gemini might require paid tokens to fully access all capabilities for model fine-tuning, especially at scale.

### Points of Consideration

- **Token Requirements**: Similar to OpenAIâ€™s ChatGPT, advanced functionalities in Gemini, including significant fine-tuning with large image datasets, may require paid tokens.
- **Free Version Capabilities**: The free version of Gemini may support basic interactions and potentially some smaller-scale fine-tuning tasks. However, testing would be necessary to understand its limitations in image-based applications.
- **Potential Costs**: If token payment is needed for larger-scale fine-tuning, a cost analysis would be necessary to determine the feasibility of this approach for our project.

Further exploration and testing in the Colab environment will reveal more about how effectively we can use Gemini for our specific project requirements.

But, taken this point into account, we should initially discard google colab + gemini option.
