# Is there any similar approach based in glaucoma using ZSL technique ?

In this section I explore if there's a similar approach using "Zero Shot Learning" Applied to our case of study, and in the first surveys I did, I discovered the following resource:

["One-Vote Veto: Semi-Supervised Learning for Low-Shot Glaucoma Diagnosis"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.04841v4)

This resource, which is not directly related to what I have in mind, gives an idea on the results of using "Few Shot learning", which is partically the same as Zero Shot, but using few known examples of each label.
