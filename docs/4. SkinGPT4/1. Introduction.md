# Introduction

In this section I will be downloading, setting up, and using the reference software that I mentioned on the Initial Research, "SkinGPT4" Avaiable at: https://github.com/JoshuaChou2018/SkinGPT-4 to see if it could be a mother base sutibale to develop the LLM glaucoma application.

First I will try to set up this software, with their own dataset to check if the program is correctly working, just go ahead to the next page.
