## Introduction to Vision Language Models (VLLMs)

Vision Language Models (VLLMs) represent a class of models that combine vision and language processing abilities.
These models are designed to interpret and generate human-readable descriptions from visual data (such as images) 
by leveraging extensive pre-trained architectures that process both text and image data. Typical examples include models 
like CLIP, which matches images with text descriptions, and multi-modal transformers like Flan-T5, which can generate 
text outputs based on prompts or features extracted from images.

### Hardware Requirements and Limitations

VLLMs often require significant computational power to function effectively, particularly for tasks involving high-resolution 
images or complex language processing tasks. The hardware limitations for working with these models include:

- **GPU Requirements**: 
  VLLMs frequently require GPUs with high memory capacity (at least 16GB VRAM) to handle large batches of image and text data. 
  GPUs from NVIDIA’s A100 or T4 line, commonly available on platforms like Google Colab, are ideal for running these models. 
  Higher-end GPUs facilitate faster processing and support larger model versions.

- **RAM Constraints**:
  Running and fine-tuning large VLLMs, especially with models that include billions of parameters (e.g., models like LLaMA 3.2 with 7 billion parameters), 
  can require upwards of 24GB of RAM. Lower RAM capacities can lead to slower processing times, increased latency, and the inability 
  to handle very large models without memory errors.

- **Inference and Fine-Tuning Considerations**:
  Fine-tuning a VLLM typically demands more resources than standard inference (using a model without modification). The fine-tuning process 
  involves adjusting the model’s internal weights and requires both more memory and prolonged GPU access. 
  Access to high-performance cloud instances, such as Colab Pro, can mitigate these limitations, offering faster and more efficient fine-tuning processes.

These hardware requirements often limit accessibility to VLLMs, especially for personal or limited-budget projects. 
Efficient memory management and model optimization strategies are necessary to deploy VLLMs effectively without overwhelming available resources.
