# Continuing with the Initial Research

Building on the expertise and background provided by the previous references, I began exploring ways to connect a Large Language Model (LLM) with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), fine-tuning them to achieve optimal accuracy.

## Exploration of Open Source Solutions

Initially, I am focusing on open-source codes to maintain control over the inner processes when working with glaucoma images/datasets using CNNs or Vision Transformers (ViTs). Additionally, considering the costs associated with paid token-based models like ChatGPT and Gemini, scaling up could become costly. However, we haven't ruled out the possibility of using OpenAI's paid tokens if required.

I discovered an intriguing resource developed by Chinese researchers at King Abdullah University in Saudi Arabia. This model facilitates fine-tuning with Vicuna and LLaMa 2. Here is the link to their page:

- [MiniGPT-4 Project Website](https://minigpt-4.github.io/)

Their research paper, detailing the model's internal workings, is available here:

- [MiniGPT-4 Research Paper (arXiv)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.09478)

The source code for this model is available on GitHub:

## Additional Insights on Adaptability

I was also asked to investigate how this software could be adapted to our specific needs. During my research, I found the following paper:

- [SkinGPT-4 Research Paper](https://github.com/JoshuaChou2018/SkinGPT-4/blob/main/s41467-024-50043-3.pdf)

This paper discusses how an adaptation of MiniGPT-4 was implemented to diagnose skin diseases. This suggests that, by loading the necessary datasets and making relevant adjustments, this software could potentially be adapted to diagnose glaucoma as well.

Further updates will be provided in the next section.
