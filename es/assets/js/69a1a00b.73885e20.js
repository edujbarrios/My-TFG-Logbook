With access to models that can analyze retinographies, healthcare providers have new tools that complement their expertise, enhancing accuracy and response times.\\n\\nGitHub\'s Model Marketplace offers a broad selection of pre-trained LLMs, including models fine-tuned for medical diagnostics. These models can be evaluated on specific tasks to understand their effectiveness in real-world medical applications and explore where future **fine-tuning** could provide further enhancements.\\n\\n## Step-by-Step Guide to Using GitHub Model Marketplace\\n\\nThe GitHub Model Marketplace provides access to a variety of models tailored for different diagnostic tasks. In this guide, we\u2019ll demonstrate how to use these models to analyze a retinography and assess their diagnostic capabilities for glaucoma detection.\\n\\n### Step 1: Finding a Model in the Marketplace\\n\\n1. Go to the **GitHub Model Marketplace** and search for relevant medical diagnostic models, such as those trained on retinography analysis.\\n2. Select a model that suits your diagnostic needs. Review model descriptions to ensure it has been fine-tuned on medical imaging data specific to retinal images, which is essential for reliable results.\\n\\nThis first step allows you to choose a model that is already partially prepared for diagnostic tasks in ophthalmology, although these models may benefit from additional fine-tuning in the future for even more accurate results.\\n\\n### Step 2: Setting Up Your Environment\\n\\nTo get started, make sure you have the necessary libraries installed, such as `torch`, `transformers`, and `PIL` for image processing. You can install them using:\\n\\n```bash\\npip install torch transformers pillow\\n```\\n\\nSetting up a consistent environment ensures reproducibility and allows for seamless testing across multiple models.\\n\\n### Step 3: Loading and Testing the Model\\n\\nThe next step is to load the chosen model from the GitHub Model Marketplace and apply it to a retinography image:\\n\\n```python\\nfrom transformers import AutoModelForImageClassification, AutoFeatureExtractor\\nfrom PIL import Image\\nimport torch\\n\\n# Load model from GitHub Model Marketplace\\nmodel_name = \\"your-chosen-model\\"  # Replace with the model ID from the marketplace\\nmodel = AutoModelForImageClassification.from_pretrained(model_name)\\nfeature_extractor = AutoFeatureExtractor.from_pretrained(model_name)\\n\\n# Load a retinography image\\nimage = Image.open(\\"path_to_retinography_image.jpg\\")\\ninputs = feature_extractor(images=image, return_tensors=\\"pt\\")\\n\\n# Make predictions\\nwith torch.no_grad():\\n    outputs = model(**inputs)\\n    predictions = torch.nn.functional.softmax(outputs.logits, dim=-1)\\n    print(\\"Prediction results:\\", predictions)\\n```\\n\\nThis step allows you to assess the model\'s baseline performance, which could be refined with future fine-tuning tailored to glaucoma detection.\\n\\n### Step 4: Setting a Role-Specific Prompt\\n\\nFor a more accurate assessment, defining a specific role that aligns with the diagnostic goal can direct the model\u2019s focus. In this case, we\u2019ll assume the role of an **ophthalmologist focusing on glaucoma detection**:\\n\\n- Adjust the input prompt or model configuration to specify: **\\"As an ophthalmologist specializing in glaucoma detection, analyze this retinography for signs of glaucoma. Pay special attention to optic nerve cupping, retinal nerve fiber layer thinning, and characteristic glaucomatous changes that could indicate early-stage or advanced glaucoma.\\"**\\n\\nThis prompt introduces role-specific expertise, helping the model prioritize clinically relevant features for glaucoma, such as optic nerve health and retinal changes.\\n\\n```python\\n# Example prompt setting (if supported by the model or input setup)\\nprompt = \\"As an ophthalmologist specializing in glaucoma detection, assess this retinography for optic nerve cupping, retinal thinning, and glaucomatous changes.\\"\\n# Adjust model inputs or preprocessing as required by the model\'s API.\\n```\\n\\nThis step not only adds clarity to the model\u2019s task but also opens up the possibility of fine-tuning. By collecting results from multiple cases, you can refine prompts and data inputs for better outcomes, especially for highly specific diagnostic tasks.\\n\\n### Step 5: Evaluating Model Performance\\n\\nOnce you have the model configured, evaluate its performance with metrics like **accuracy**, **sensitivity**, and **specificity** to determine its effectiveness in detecting glaucoma.\\n\\n### Potential for Fine-Tuning\\n\\nWith diagnostic tasks as specialized as glaucoma detection, there is significant potential for **fine-tuning**. Fine-tuning involves training the model on a dataset specifically curated for glaucoma or other ophthalmologic conditions, allowing it to learn patterns and markers associated with these diseases in detail.\\n\\nBy fine-tuning on a large dataset of labeled retinographies, for instance, the model can learn nuanced patterns that may indicate early-stage glaucoma. Fine-tuning could be conducted with frameworks such as **PyTorch** or **TensorFlow**, and would require a labeled dataset of glaucoma-positive and negative cases for best results.\\n\\nFine-tuning steps could involve:\\n\\n```python\\nfrom transformers import Trainer, TrainingArguments\\n\\n# Training parameters\\ntraining_args = TrainingArguments(\\n    output_dir=\\"./results\\",\\n    num_train_epochs=3,\\n    per_device_train_batch_size=8,\\n    logging_dir=\\"./logs\\",\\n)\\n\\n# Set up Trainer with the labeled retinography dataset\\ntrainer = Trainer(\\n    model=model,\\n    args=training_args,\\n    train_dataset=glaucoma_dataset,  # replace with your glaucoma-specific dataset\\n)\\n\\ntrainer.train()\\n```\\n\\nThis added step not only enhances diagnostic accuracy but also customizes the model for specific needs in glaucoma detection, potentially aiding in the early diagnosis of this sight-threatening condition.\\n\\n### Best Practices\\n\\n- **Data Preparation**: Ensure the input images are high quality and properly preprocessed for optimal accuracy.\\n- **Prompt Customization**: Tailor prompts to emphasize specific indicators of glaucoma in retinography images.\\n- **Performance Metrics**: Use relevant metrics like **accuracy**, **sensitivity**, and **specificity** to assess model reliability in detecting glaucoma.\\n- **Iterative Fine-Tuning**: As more labeled data becomes available, consider additional rounds of fine-tuning for increased diagnostic precision.\\n\\n:::tip\\nUtilizing GitHub\'s Model Marketplace lets you experiment with a variety of models, helping you find the most effective options for specific diagnostic tasks, such as glaucoma detection.\\n:::\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nTesting LLMs from the GitHub Model Marketplace allows healthcare providers and AI developers to explore state-of-the-art models in medical diagnostics. With easy access to these tools, professionals can enhance diagnostic precision, adding valuable support to traditional medical practices. Fine-tuning opportunities also mean these models can be continually improved, offering the potential for ongoing advancements in glaucoma detection and beyond.\\n\\n---"},{"id":"neural-networks-fine-tuning-llms","metadata":{"permalink":"/My-TFG-Logbook/es/blog/neural-networks-fine-tuning-llms","source":"@site/blog/neural-networks-fine-tuning-llms.mdx","title":"Leveraging Neural Networks and Fine-Tuning in Large Language Models: A Synergy for Enhanced AI Capabilities","description":"In the realm of artificial intelligence, neural networks and fine-tuning are fundamental components that drive the capabilities of large language models (LLMs), like GPT-4 and beyond.

Current diagnostic methods require specialized expertise and equipment, making them inaccessible in many areas. However, innovations in **zero-shot learning** and lightweight AI models like CLIP offer a new frontier in glaucoma detection, bridging the gap between cutting-edge technology and practical application.\\n\\nBased on insights from previous research notebooks, this blog delves into how ZSL and CLIP\u2019s lightweight architecture enable affordable, accurate, and accessible diagnostic tools.\\n\\n## What is Zero-Shot Learning?\\n\\nZero-shot learning (ZSL) enables AI models to make predictions for unseen classes or tasks without explicit prior training on those specific categories. In the context of medical imaging, ZSL can revolutionize diagnostics by eliminating the need for extensive annotated datasets for every medical condition.\\n\\nFor example, a ZSL-enabled CLIP model can analyze a retinal image and respond to a prompt like, *\\"Identify signs of glaucoma in this image,\\"* even if it has never been explicitly trained on glaucoma-specific datasets.\\n\\n### Key Benefits of ZSL in Medical Imaging\\n\\n- **Eliminates the Need for Large Datasets**: Unlike traditional supervised learning, ZSL requires minimal specific labeled data, reducing the time and cost of model training.\\n- **Flexible Diagnosis**: The ability to interpret natural language prompts makes ZSL adaptable to various medical scenarios.\\n- **Scalability**: ZSL models can be deployed across different diagnostic tasks without retraining.\\n\\n:::tip\\nZero-shot learning is particularly suited for conditions with limited labeled datasets, such as rare diseases or early-stage glaucoma.\\n:::\\n\\n## Why CLIP for Glaucoma Detection?\\n\\nCLIP\u2019s ability to link text and image embeddings makes it an ideal candidate for ZSL in medical imaging. It\u2019s lightweight, requiring less than **1 GB**, and runs efficiently on most hardware, including resource-constrained PCs. Unlike other models that depend on external APIs or expensive computational resources, CLIP can operate offline, enabling deployment in remote or under-resourced clinics.\\n\\n### Advantages of Using CLIP\\n\\n- **Language-Guided Diagnostics**: CLIP can interpret prompts like *\\"Does this retinography indicate optic nerve damage?\\"* and return visual features corresponding to the query.\\n- **Affordable Implementation**: By eliminating API dependencies, CLIP reduces operational costs.\\n- **Broad Compatibility**: Its compact architecture allows integration into desktop applications and hospital systems without requiring high-end GPUs.\\n\\n## Fine-Tuning CLIP for Glaucoma Detection\\n\\nWhile ZSL enables CLIP to generalize across tasks, fine-tuning the model on domain-specific data improves its performance for tasks like glaucoma detection. This process aligns the model\u2019s text and image embeddings with medical-specific terminology and visual features.\\n\\n### Fine-Tuning Example\\n\\n```python\\nfrom transformers import CLIPProcessor, CLIPModel, Trainer, TrainingArguments\\n\\n# Load pre-trained CLIP model\\nmodel = CLIPModel.from_pretrained(\\"openai/clip-vit-base-patch32\\")\\nprocessor = CLIPProcessor.from_pretrained(\\"openai/clip-vit-base-patch32\\")\\n\\n# Prepare the dataset\\ntrain_dataset = prepare_medical_dataset(\\"retinographies\\", \\"glaucoma_labels\\")\\n\\n# Training arguments\\ntraining_args = TrainingArguments(\\n    output_dir=\\"./results\\",\\n    num_train_epochs=5,\\n    per_device_train_batch_size=16,\\n)\\n\\n# Fine-tune the model\\ntrainer = Trainer(\\n    model=model,\\n    args=training_args,\\n    train_dataset=train_dataset,\\n)\\n\\ntrainer.train()"}]}}')}}]);
